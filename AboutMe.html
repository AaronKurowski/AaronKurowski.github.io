        <div class="about-me-text">Hi! I'm Aaron and welcome to my fist ever website!<br>
            I graduated from UW - Parkside in 2019 with a BS in mathematics. It was great. I loved every 
            second of it, even the rough parts. Problem solving excites me and rote learning keeps me 
            honest. I am currently enrolled in devCodeCamp and learning the ropes of full stack software 
            development. Coding, to me, is a very welcoming medium to see cool ideas grow!
            <br><br>
            More personally, I have been a drummer since about 10 years old and still play live shows with
            Milwaukee punk band Mud Dog. I always stay active and love a good pick up
             game of basketball.
            <br><br>
            Anyway, thank you for visiting. I hope my projects will show you the kind of baseline quality 
            I aim to achieve.
